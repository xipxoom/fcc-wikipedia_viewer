# fcc-wikipedia_viewer
Wikipedia viewer project for Free Code Camp

## Summary:
The fifth project for [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com)'s front end program is a [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) viewer.  The video shows the fetching of data from the API for filling in autocomplete entries.  This isn't a listed requirement but would be a nice touch.  It might be possible to render the selected Wikipedia entry in the same page instead of opening a new tab.  *Note: This works but the results have bad relative links and no images so I'll opt not to do this.*

## Objective:
Build a [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io) app that is functionally similar to the [example project](http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/pgNRvJ).

### Rules:
1. Don't look at the example project's code.  Figure it out for yourself.
2. Fulfill the below user stories.  Use whichever libraries or APIs you need.  Give it your own personal style.

### User Stories:
* I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
* I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

### Hints:
1. Here's a URL you can use to get a random Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random
2. Here's an entry on using Wikipedia's API: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page.
3. Use this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ApiSandbox#action=query&titles=Main%20Page&prop=revisions&rvprop=content&format=jsonfm) to experiment with Wikipedia's API.

## Libraries:
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [jquery-template](https://github.com/codepb/jquery-template)
